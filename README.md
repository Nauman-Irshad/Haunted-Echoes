Project Overview: Haunted Echoes

I am excited to present my latest project, Haunted Echoes, a Survival Horror Game I developed using Java. This project is the result of applying what I’ve learned from the Unreal Engine - Ultimate Survival Horror Course offered by Packt on Coursera, which has greatly expanded my knowledge of atmospheric game design, integrating horror mechanics, and powerful AI systems. Through this project, I aimed to create a game that immerses players in a chilling environment filled with unpredictable threats and complex puzzles, all while challenging their survival instincts.

The Concept of Haunted Echoes

Haunted Echoes takes place in a dark and eerie world, where players are thrust into a haunted environment filled with vengeful spirits, dangerous AI threats, and cryptic puzzles. The game's primary goal is to navigate through unsettling landscapes while uncovering a chilling narrative about lost souls and dark forces that control the realm. Players must use their wits, survival skills, and problem-solving abilities to overcome the threats they encounter, all while unraveling a disturbing mystery that ties the whole experience together.

The game is driven by three core elements: atmospheric level design, horror mechanics, and AI integration. These components are the foundation upon which I built the immersive experience, and each contributes significantly to the overall feeling of tension and fear throughout the game.

Course Influence: Unreal Engine – Ultimate Survival Horror Course

The Unreal Engine - Ultimate Survival Horror Course from Coursera provided me with the knowledge necessary to bring the vision of Haunted Echoes to life. The course covers several aspects of horror game development, starting with the basics of atmospheric level design and moving toward more advanced topics such as AI systems integration and the use of famous horror mechanics.

One of the key takeaways from this course was the importance of atmosphere. Horror games thrive on creating an environment that instills fear in the player without relying solely on jump scares. The course taught me how to use elements such as lighting, sound, and environment design to create an immersive and tense atmosphere. For Haunted Echoes, I paid close attention to the lighting, using dim and flickering lights to create a sense of uncertainty. Sound effects, such as distant whispers and creaking doors, were used to unsettle players and heighten their anxiety. These elements work together to keep the player on edge throughout the game, as they feel like they are constantly being watched by unseen forces.
